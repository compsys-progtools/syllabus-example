<h3>About this course<a class="headerlink" href="#about-this-course" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>In this course we will study the tools that we use as programmers and use them as a lens to study
the computer system itself.  We will begin with two fundamental tools: version control and the shell. We will focus on git and bash as popular examples of each. Sometimes understanding the tools requires understanding an aspect of the system, for example git uses cryptographic hashing which requires understanding number systems.  Other times the tools helps us see how parts work: the shell is our interface to the operating system. We will survey the computer system across levels of abstraction from applications to hardware. Throughout, we will consider social conventions and practices within programming and the historical development of computer systems.</p>

<div class="section" id="learning-outcomes">
<h3>Learning Outcomes<a class="headerlink" href="#learning-outcomes" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>The goal is for you to learn and the grading is designed to as close as possible actually
align to how much you have learned.  So, the first thing to keep in mind, always is the
course learning outcomes:</p>
<p>By the end of the semester, students will be able to:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Apply common design patterns and abstractions to understand new code bases, programming tools, and components of systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Apply appropriate programming workflows using context-relevant tools that enable adherance to best practices for effective code, developer time efficiency, and collaboration.</p></li>
<li><p>Differentiate the different classes of tools used in computer science in terms of their features, roles, and how they interact and justify positions and preferences among popular tools</p></li>
<li><p>Identify how information flows across levels of abstraction.</p></li>
<li><p>Discuss implications of design choices across levels of abstraction</p></li>
<li><p>Describe the social context in which essential components of computing systems were developed and explain the impact of that context on the systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Differentiate between social conventions and technical requirements in programming contexts.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="structure">
<h3>Structure<a class="headerlink" href="#structure" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>This class is cerntered on active learning.  Over the course of the semester, we will cover topics through multiple lenses so that you get multiple chances to build skill with the tools that we are learning and see how the important concepts repeat in different ways throughout</p>
<p>There will prescribed preparation work for each class session that either helps you preview tricky topics in advance or refresh your memory of prerequisite material so that you are ready to learn the new material.</p>
<p>In class we will focus on answering a new question together each session through a combination of inquiry-driven participatory live coding and discussions. You will be expected to follow along with the activity and answer questions to check understanding.</p>
<p>After each class there will 2 sets of activities based on that material, you can choose which level to work at.  The review level activities require you to review what was done in class and ensure that you understand it.  The practice level tasks give you a chance to get more practice and apply your understanding in new ways beyond what we do in class.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="topics">
<h3>Topics<a class="headerlink" href="#topics" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>This is the planned schedule, but is subject to change in order to adapt to how things go in class or additional questions that come up.</p>
<p>Each class we will answer a motivating question in a way that integrates important practical skills, conceptual knowledge, and social context of computer systems and programming tools.</p>
<p>We will focus on <em>learning</em> the tools to start, treating them as an example of how computer systems are designed and then <em>using</em> the tools to study the system in the second half of the semester.</p>

<p>Lab provides extra support and accountability.  Some lab activities will directly be time to work on tasks from review or practice badges.  Some lab activities will help you review class material. Some lab activities will include self-assessments and reflection on your course progress to ensure that you are not falling behind.</p>
<p>Every week at the end of lab you will “check out” with a TA or instructor, reviewing your work and showing that you completed any setup or install steps that are needed for the upcoming classes. The checkout is evaluated only on completion, any components that are important to get correct will be assessed in a review or practice badge.</p>

<h2>Tools and Resources<a class="headerlink" href="#tools-and-resources" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>We will use a variety of tools to conduct class and to facilitate your programming.
You will need a computer with Linux, MacOS, or Windows. It is unlikely that a tablet
will be able to do all of the things required in this course. A Chromebook may work,
especially with developer tools turned on. Ask Dr. Brown if you need help getting access
to an adequate computer.</p>
<p>All of the tools and resources below are either:</p>

<p>In this course, we will use several programming environments. In order to participate in class and complete assignments you need the items listed in the requirements list. The easiest way to meet these requirements is to follow the recommendations below. I will provide instruction assuming that you have followed the recommendations, however if you have alternative environments they will mostly work.
We will add tools throughout the semester, but the following will be enough
to get started.</p>

<h2>Grading<a class="headerlink" href="#grading" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>This section of the syllabus describes the principles and mechanics of the grading for the course.
The course is designed around your learning so the grading is based on you demonstrating how much you have learned, but not based on how quickly you learn it.</p>
<p>Additionally, since we will be studying programming tools, we will use them to administer
the course. To give you a chance to get used to the tools there will be a penalty free zone
for the first few weeks.</p>
<div class="section" id="principles-of-grading">
<h3>Principles of Grading<a class="headerlink" href="#principles-of-grading" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Learning happens through practice and feedback. My goal as a teacher is for you to learn.
The grading in this course is designed to reflect how deeply you learn the material, even
if it takes you multiple attempts to truly understand a topic. The topics in this course
are all topics that will come back in later courses in the Computer Science major, so it is important that you understand
each of them <em>correctly</em> so that it helps in the next course.</p>
<p>This course is designed to encourage you to work steadily at learning the material
and demonstrating your new knowledge. There are no single points of failure, where
you lose points that cannot be recovered. Also, you cannot cram anything one time
and then forget it. The material will build and you have to demonstrate that you
retained material. You will be required to demonstrate understanding of the connections
between ides from different parts of the course.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Earning a C in this class means you have a general understanding; you will know what all the terms mean; you could follow along in a meeting where others were discussing systems concepts and use core tools for common tasks. You know where to start when looking things up.</p></li>
<li><p>Earning a B means that you can apply the course concepts in other programming environments; you can solve basic common errors without looking much up.</p></li>
<li><p>Earning an A means that you can use knowledge from this course to debug tricky scenarios; you know where to start and can form good hypotheses about why uncommon errors have occurred; you can confidently figure out new complex systems.</p></li>
</ul>
<!-- Earning an A  -->
<p>The course is designed for you to <em>succeed</em> at a level of your choice.  As you accumulate
knowledge, the grading in this course is designed to be cumulative instead of based on
deducting points and averaging. No matter what level of work you choose to engage in, you will be expected
to revise work until it is correct.  The material in this course will all come back in other
300 and 400 level CSC courses, so it is essential that you do not leave this course with
misconceptions, as they will make it harder for you to learn related material later.</p>
<!-- ```{admonition} If you made an error in an assignment what do you need to do?

</div>
<div class="section" id="penalty-free-zone">
<h3>Penalty-free Zone<a class="headerlink" href="#penalty-free-zone" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Since learning developer tools is a core learning outcome of the course, we will also use them for all aspects of administering the course. This will help you learn these tools really well and create accountability for getting enough practice with core operations, but it also creates a high stakes situation: even submitting your work requires you understanding the tools. This would not be very fair at the beginning of the semester.</p>
<p>For the first three weeks we will have a low stakes penalty-free zone where we will provide extra help and reminders for how to get feedback on your work. In this period, deadlines are more flexible as well. If work is submitted incorrectly, we will still see it because we will manually go look for all activities. After this zone, we will assume you <em>chose</em> to skip something if we do not see it.</p>
<!-- 
```{admonition} What happens if you merged a PR without feedback?
:class: checkin, dropdown

During the Penalty-Free zone, we will help you figure that out and fix it so you get credit for it.  After that, you have to fix it on your own (or in office hours) in order to get credit.

<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>If there are terms in the rest of this section that do not make sense while we are in the penalty-free zone, do not panic. This zone exists to help you get familiar with the terms needed to succeed in the course.</p>

<p>During the third week, you will create a course plan where you establish your goals for the course and I make sure that you all understand the requirements to complete your goals.</p>
<!-- 
```{admonition} What happens if you're confused by the grading scheme right now?

<div class="section" id="learning-badges">
<span id="badgecounts"></span><h3>Learning Badges<a class="headerlink" href="#learning-badges" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Your grade will be based on you choosing to work with the material at different levels and participating in the class community in different ways. Each of these represents different types of badges that you can earn as you accumulate evidence of your learning and engagment.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>experience: guided in class acitivies</p></li>
<li><p>review: just the basics</p></li>
<li><p>practice: a little bit more indepdendent</p></li>
<li><p>explore: posing your own directions of inquiry</p></li>
<li><p>build: in depth- application of course topics</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Review and practice badges are dated and you can only earn one of the two for each date. All of these badges will be tracked through PRs in your kwl repo. Each PR must have a title that includes the badge type and associated date. We will use scripts over these to track your progress.</p>
<p>To earn a D you must complete:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>22 experience badges</p></li>
<li><p>13 lab check outs</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To earn a C you must complete:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>22 experience badges</p></li>
<li><p>13 lab check outs</p></li>
<li><p>18 review badges</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To earn a B you must complete:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>22 experience badges</p></li>
<li><p>13 lab check outs</p></li>
<li><p>your choice:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>18 practice badges</p></li>
<li><p>12 review + 12 practice</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For an A you must complete:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>22 experience badges</p></li>
<li><p>13 lab check outs</p></li>
<li><p>your choice:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>18 practice badges + 6 explore badges</p></li>
<li><p>18 review badges + 3 build badges</p></li>
<li><p>6 review badges + 12 practice badges +  4 explore badges + 1 build badges</p></li>
<li><p>12 review badges + 6 practice  badges+ 2 explore badges + 2 build badges</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also mix and match to get +/-. For example
(all examples below assume 22+ experience badges aand 13 lab checkouts)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A-: 18 practice + 4 explore</p></li>
<li><p>B+: 6 review + 12 practice +  4 explore</p></li>
<li><p>B-: 6 review + 12 practice</p></li>
<li><p>B+: 24 practice</p></li>
<li><p>C+: 12 review + 6 practice</p></li>
</ul>
<!-- 
```{warning}
These counts assume that the semester goes as planned and that there are 26 available badges of each base type (experience, review, practice).  If the number of available badges decreases by more than 2 for any reason (eg snowdays, instructor illness, etc) the threshold for experience badges will be decreased.
```

```{important}
 There will be 20 review and practice badges available after the penalty free zone. This means that missing the review and practice badges in the penalty free zone cannot hurt you. However, it does not mean it is a good idea to not attempt them, not attempting them at all will make future badges harder, because reviewing early ideas are important for later ideas. 
```

You cannot earn both practice and review badges for the same class session, but most practice badge requirements will include the review requirements plus some extra steps.  

(integrative)=
In the second half of the semester, there will be special *integrative* badge opportunities that have multipliers attached to them. These badges will count for more than one. For example an integrative 2x review badge counts as two review badges.  These badges will be more complex than regular badges and therefore count more.  

```{admonition} Can you do any combination of badges?
:class: checkin, dropdown

No, you cannot earn practice and review for the same date.

</div>
<div class="section" id="community-badges">
<h3>Community Badges<a class="headerlink" href="#community-badges" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Community badges are awarded for extra community participation. Both programming and learning are most effective with good collaboration.  Since being a good member of our class community helps you learn (and helps others learn better), some collaboration is required in other badges. Some dimensions of community participation can only be done once, for example fixing a typo on the course website, so while it’s valuable, all students cannot contribute to the course community in the same way. To reward these unique contributions, you can earn a community badge.</p>
<p>You can see some ideas as they arise by <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/introcompsys/fall2023/labels/community">issues labeled <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">community</span></code> on the course website repo</a>.</p>
<p>Community badges can replace missed experience, review, and practice badges, upgrade a review to a practice badge, or they can be used as an alternate way to earn a + modifier on a D,C,or B (URI doesn’t award A+s, sorry).  Community badges are smaller, so they are not 1:1 replacements for other badges. You can earn a maximum of 14 community badges, generally one per week.  Extra helpful contributions may be awarded 2 community badges, but that does not increase your limit. When you earn them, you can plan how you will use it, but they will only be officially applied to your grade at the end of the semester.  They will automatically be applied in the way that gives you the maximum benefit.</p>
<p>Community Badge values:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>3 community = 1 experience badge</p></li>
<li><p>4 community = 1 review</p></li>
<li><p>7 community = 1 practice.</p></li>
<li><p>3 community badges + 1 review = 1 practice.</p></li>
<li><p>10 community = add a  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">+</span></code> to a D,C, or B, <strong>note that this is more efficient.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can earn community badges by:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>fixing small issues on the course website (during penalty free zone only)</p></li>
<li><p>contributing extra terms or reviews to your team repo</p></li>
<li><p>sharing articles and discussing them in the course discussions</p></li>
<li><p>contributing annotated resources the course website</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will maintain a list of your contributions in your KWL repo in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">community_contributions.md</span></code> file. Every individual change to this file (representing one contribution) should be commited to a new branch and then submitted as a PR, with a review requested from &#64;brownsarahm.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Some participation in your group repo and a small number of discussions will be required for experience, review, and practice badges. This means that not every single contribution or peer review to your team repo will earn a community badge.</p>
</div>
<p>Example(nonexhaustive) uses:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>22 experience + 17 review + 11 community = C (replace 2 experience, 1 review)</p></li>
<li><p>24 experience + 17 review + 5 community = C (replace 1 review)</p></li>
<li><p>24 experience + 18 review + 10 community = C+ (modifier)</p></li>
<li><p>24 experience + 18 practice + 10 community = B+ (modifier)</p></li>
<li><p>23 experience + 18 practice + 13 community = B+ (modifier, replace 1 experience)</p></li>
<li><p>24 experience + 16 practice + 2 review + 10 community = B  (upgrade 2 review)</p></li>
<li><p>24 experience + 10 review + 10 community + 6 practice + 3 explore + 2 build = A (replace 2 review)</p></li>
<li><p>24 experience + 14 review + 10 community + 4 practice + 3 explore + 2 build = A (upgrade 2 review to practice)</p></li>
<li><p>24 experience + 12 review + 14 community + 4 practice + 3 build =A (replace 2 practice)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These show that community badges can save you work at the end of the semester by reducing the number of practice badges or simplifying badges</p>

<h3><span class="fa fa-gift"></span> Free corrections<a class="headerlink" href="#free-corrections" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>All work must be correct and complete to earn credit. In general, this means that when your work is not correct, we will give you guiding questions and advice so that you can revise the work to be correct. Most of the time asking you questions is the best way to help you learn, but sometimes, especially for small things, showing you a correct example makes the most sense.</p>
<p>Additionally, on rare occasions, a student can submit work that is incorrect or will have down-the-line consquences but does not demonstrate a misunderstanding. For example, in an experience badge, putting text below the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#</span> </code> line instead of replacing the hint within the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span></code>.  Later, we will do things within the kwl repo that will rely on the title line being filled in, but it’s not a big revision where the student needs to rethink about what they submitted.</p>
<p>In these special occasions, good effort that is not technically correct may be rewarded with a <span class="fa fa-gift"></span>. In this case, the instructor or TA will give a <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request#applying-suggested-changes">suggestion</a>, with the <span class="fa fa-gift"></span> emoji in the comment and leave a review as “comment” instead of “changes requested” or “approved”. If the student commits the suggestion to acknowledge that they read it, the instructor will then leave an approving review. Free corrections are only available when revisions are otherwise eligible.  This means that they cannot extend a deadline and they are not available on the final grading that occurs after our scheduled “exam time”.</p>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>These free corrections are used at the instructional team’s discretion and are not guaranteed.</p>
<p>This means that, for example, the same mistake the first time, might get a <span class="fa fa-gift"></span>, a second will probably be a hint, and a third or fourth time might be a regular revision where we ask you to go review prior assignments to figure out what you need to fix with a broad hint instead of the specific suggestion.</p>

<h3>Ungrading Option<a class="headerlink" href="#ungrading-option" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>At the end of the semester, you have the option of submitting a final reflection that states what grade you think you deserve, and justifies it by summarizing what you have learned and providing evidence of that.  Instructions for this option will be provided as we approach the end of the semester. The policy of no submitted content that was not generated by you still applies. If you take this option, you may be required to also take an oral exam by appointment to supplement the evidence provided in your reflection.</p>
<p>This option exists in recognition of the fact that grading schemes are not perfect and I am truly committed to your learning.  If you think that the grading scheme described on this page is working out to you earning a different grade than you deserve and you can support that with strong evidence that you have learned, you can have the grade you deserve.</p>

<h3>Academic Honesty<a class="headerlink" href="#academic-honesty" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>All of your work must reflect your own thinking and understanding.  The work that you submit must all be your own work or content that was provided to you in class, it cannot include text that was generated by an AI or plagiarized in any other way. You may use auto-complete in all tools and GitHub co-pilot for any code that is required for this course because the code is necessary to demonstrate examples, but language syntax is not the core learning outcome.</p>
<p>If you are found to submit prismia responses that do not reflect your own thinking or that of discussion with peers as directed, the experience badge for that class session will be ineligible.</p>
<p>If work is suspected, you will be allowed to take an oral exam in lab time to contest and prove that your work reflects your own understanding.</p>
<p>The first time you will be allowed to appeal through an oral exam. If your appeal is successful, your counter resets. If you are found to have violated the policy then the badge in question will be ineligible and your maximum number of badges possible to be earned will be limited (you cannot treat the plagiarized badge as skipped).</p>
<!-- If you violate a second time, no further work will be graded for the remainder of the semester.  -->
<p>If you are found to submit work that is not your own for a review or prepare badge, the review and prepare badges for that date will be ineligible and the penalty free zone terms will no longer apply to the first six badges.</p>
<p>If you are found to submit work that is not your own for an explore or build  badge, that badge will not be awarded and your maximum badges at the level possible will drop to 2/3 of the maximum possible.</p>

<h3>Academic Honesty<a class="headerlink" href="#academic-honesty" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Students are expected to be honest in all academic work.

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Using material, directly or paraphrasing, from published sources (print or electronic) without appropriate citation</p></li>
<li><p>Claiming disproportionate credit for work not done independently</p></li>
