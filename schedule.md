# Format and Schedule

## Structure

This class is cerntered on active learning.  Over the course of the semester, we will cover topics through multiple lenses so that you get multiple chances to build skill with the tools that we are learning and see how the important concepts repeat in different ways throughout

There will prescribed preparation work for each class session that either helps you preview tricky topics in advance or refresh your memory of prerequisite material so that you are ready to learn the new material.  

In class we will focus on answering a new question together each session through a combination of inquiry-driven participatory live coding and discussions. You will be expected to follow along with the activity and answer questions to check understanding.  

After each class there will 2 sets of activities based on that material, you can choose which level to work at.  The review level activities require you to review what was done in class and ensure that you understand it.  The practice level tasks give you a chance to get more practice and apply your understanding in new ways beyond what we do in class.  




## Topics

This is the planned schedule, but is subject to change in order to adapt to how things go in class or additional questions that come up. 

Each class we will answer a motivating question in a way that integrates important practical skills, conceptual knowledge, and social context of computer systems and programming tools.  

We will focus on *learning* the tools to start, treating them as an example of how computer systems are designed and then *using* the tools to study the system in the second half of the semester.

##  Lab schedule

Lab provides extra support and accountability.  Some lab activities will directly be time to work on tasks from review or practice badges.  Some lab activities will help you review class material. Some lab activities will include self-assessments and reflection on your course progress to ensure that you are not falling behind.  

Every week at the end of lab you will "check out" with a TA or instructor, reviewing your work and showing that you completed any setup or install steps that are needed for the upcoming classes. The checkout is evaluated only on completion, any components that are important to get correct will be assessed in a review or practice badge.
